# CISHardeningScript
#
# This script automates the process (as much as possible) of hardening a Ubuntu 16.04 clean install to CIS Ubuntu Hardening benchmark.
# It is intended to be running as root and is hardcoded to harden a CLEAN install of Ubuntu 16.04. There may be problems if the install if 
# there have been a lot of changes to the machine.
